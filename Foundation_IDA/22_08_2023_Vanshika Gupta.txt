Introduction to Business Analysis and Agile


Requirement Traceablity: It ensures that each business need is tied to an actial requiremnent, and that each requirement is tied to a deliverable.It is an ability to trace a requirement forwards and backwards in the software life-development lifecycle.

* Basically, there needs/requirements are tied/mapped to test cases or defects/failure and reverse engineering can be done to find the requirement where the defect came from.

Scrum flow:
- impediment log-> when in the development stage someone is stuck.
- epic -> high-level description of requirement. (very detailed oriented)/ logical body of work
- user story -> (time-bounded)
- sprint backlog -> set of user-stories
- features -> logical breakdown of epic
- tasks -> tasks created under each user story should be completed within that same sprint.
- burnup chart -> how much work has been completed and total scope of the project.
- burndown chart -> amount of work remaining in a project (remaining effort)

* If the tasks in a user story are not completed then move it to the next sprint or backlog.


Timelines:
- sprint planning -> 2-4 hrs
- sprint review -> 30 mins
- sprint stand-up -> 15 mins
- sprint retro -> 30 mins

sprint -> 2-4 weeks
