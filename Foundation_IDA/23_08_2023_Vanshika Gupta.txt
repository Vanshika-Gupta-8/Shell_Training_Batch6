Introduction to Business Analysis and Aglie


For any enterprise question-
Epic-> Features-> Task-> Issue

In Aglie:
Feature-> Epic -> User Story -> Task

Testing-
3 types of testing:
-> white-box: where who knows coding
-> black-box: where who doesn't know how to code
-> grey-box -> automation-based

Stages of testing:
Test Strategy (For application) -> Test Planning (For each sprint) -> Test Design (For each user story) -> Test Environment (QA environment) -> Test Execution -> Defect Report -> Test Closure

* Here, test and summary report -> record of all test cases


Unit testing (done using J-unit):
- integration testing -> manual automatic -> done using selenium testing (pytest)
- system testing (functional)
- regression testing
- smoke testing
- sanity testing
- adhoc testing

Non-functional Testing (done suing J-meter Neoload):
- load testing
- stress testing
- end-to-end testing
